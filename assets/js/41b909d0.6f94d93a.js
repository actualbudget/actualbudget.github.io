Tried various different products and budgeting methodologies available at the time, but nothing really stuck. Until I found YNAB. Finally, something that helped me create and stick to a budget, and the community was really helpful as well. It felt great. I was one of their old-time customers on the "legacy" plan which did not see the price increases. That is - until 2021 when the trust of old-time customers was broken and we saw almost a 100% price increase. Even though the product was amazing - I could not justify spending as much of my disposable income on it. This made me look for alternatives.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Actual Budget enters the scene. In early 2022 James, the creator of Actual Budget, decided to close-down the commercial product and open source it.

It was a no-brainer for me."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Initially there was a lot of buzz around Actual with developers and other folks quickly joining the project and helping out, but this initial push died down.

After that we were able to start reviewing and merging the backlog of all the PRs with bug-fixes and improvements. We had roughly 50 open PRs at that stage and my personal goal was to get it down to 20 and keep it there. I never reached this number as more PRs came in when the previous ones got closed. It's was both a blessing and a curse. The community was clearly eager to help out and improve the product, but reviewing all the changes was time-consuming."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"At this stage I started building a bigger core maintainer team - recruiting some of the most active members of the community.
