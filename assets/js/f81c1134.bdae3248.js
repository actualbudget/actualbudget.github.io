These require the same amount of triage and review time as genuine contributions, but add no value. Every minute spent dealing with machine-generated junk is time not spent improving Actual itself.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Problem\\n\\nTo be clear: AI is a useful tool. We use it ourselves to draft code, fix bugs, and build features. Heck - even this article was written with the assistance of AI. But the difference is that a human is always in charge. We review, test, and take responsibility for what we merge. What we are seeing now is the opposite \u2014 unreviewed output blindly pushed upstream (i.e. opened as PRs or issues). That is not contribution; it\'s pollution.\\n\\n## Our Policy\\n\\nFrom this point on, we will close any PRs or issues that appear to be 100% AI-generated with no sign of human oversight. This isn\'t about being harsh, it\'s about protecting the limited time our maintainers have to review genuine contributions.\\n\\n## Why This Matters\\n\\nEvery AI slop PR or issue requires the same triage and review time as genuine contributions. With limited maintainer bandwidth, this directly impacts:\\n\\n- Response times for real issues and feature requests\\n- Time available for reviewing legitimate contributions\\n- Overall project velocity\\n\\nWe want to spend our time improving Actual, not filtering through automated noise.\\n\\n## How to Contribute Properly with AI\\n\\nIf you\'re using AI to help with contributions, that\'s perfectly fine! Just make sure you:\\n\\n- **Review everything** before submitting, understand what changed and why\\n- **Test your changes** - don\'t assume AI-generated code works correctly\\n- **Respond to feedback** - be ready to discuss, iterate, and improve your contribution\\n- **Take responsibility** - you\'re the one submitting it, so make sure it\'s something you stand behind\\n- **Tag them with \\"ai generated\\"** (This isn\'t something we can truly enforce, but it\'s a gesture of good will \u2014 it helps everyone in the review process know when AI was involved.)\\n\\nFor more details on how to contribute, see our [contributing guidelines](/docs/contributing/).\\n\\n## A Silver Lining\\n\\nOne small silver lining: our \\"WIP\\" (Work-In-Progress) workflow \u2014 which requires contributors to manually remove the \\"WIP\\" prefix before a PR can be reviewed \u2014 has proven effective at filtering out AI bots. It\'s an unintentional captcha we have built. Many of them can\'t complete that simple step, so their PRs go stale and close automatically.\\n\\nEven so, it would be better not to receive AI slop at all.\\n\\n## Keep It Human\\n\\nPlease, if you\'re using AI to help contribute, stay in the loop. Review, edit, and understand what you\'re submitting. Actual is built by humans, for humans. Keep it that way.\\n\\nWe\'re grateful for all genuine contributions, whether AI-assisted or not. The key is human oversight and understanding.

First of all \u2014 thank you.\\n\\nThis support allows us to make the project more sustainable for everyone involved. We want to start by addressing something that is often overlooked in open source: the invisible labor that keeps everything running.\\n\\nWe\u2019re proposing a 3-month trial program to pay our core maintainers for the essential (but often unglamorous) work of:\\n\\n- Reviewing pull requests\\n- Triage and categorize GitHub issues\\n- Preparing releases\\n\\nWe believe it\u2019s time to recognize the financial value of labor \u2014 but before we move forward, we want to hear your feedback. Join the conversation on [Discord] or leave anonymous feedback in [this form].\\n\\n> **Update:** This proposal has been approved. More details about the payment system can be found in the [paying contributors](/docs/contributing/leadership/paying-contributors) page.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What We\u2019re Proposing\\n\\nStarting July 1st, we\u2019d like to set aside $1,000 per month from the project\u2019s funds for a review stipend pool. This pool would be divided between **core maintainers** based on the work they do each month, measured via a transparent points system.\\n\\n- Points are assigned based on the size of PRs reviewed (using lines of code as a proxy for effort).\\n- Additional points are awarded for labelling and grooming issues, closing duplicates, and managing releases.\\n- The system has a cap, and in months with less activity, the payout is reduced to $500.\\n- Payments are handled via OpenCollective and are only available to core maintainers.\\n\\nThis system is designed to be lightweight, fair, and easy to administer \u2014 and it keeps our monthly costs well within our donation income.\\n\\n## Why Start With Admin Work?\\n\\nBefore we consider feature bounties or bug bounties, we need to acknowledge the day-to-day labor that enables these contributions to be merged and released. Paying for features while leaving critical administrative work unpaid would be unsustainable \u2014 and unfair.\\n\\nThis trial serves as the foundation for broader funding efforts in the future. However, it begins with respecting the work that is already being done.\\n\\n## What We Need From You\\n\\nWe believe this is the right direction \u2014 but we won\u2019t go ahead without the community\u2019s support.\\n\\n- If you\u2019re for it, against it, or have suggestions \u2014 let us know.\\n- If there\u2019s strong opposition, we won\u2019t implement it.\\n- If the community supports it, we\u2019ll begin the trial in July.\\n\\nJoin the conversation on [Discord] or leave anonymous feedback in [this form].\\nWe\u2019re listening \u2014 and we\u2019ll publish a summary of the feedback before moving forward.\\n\\n## What\u2019s Next?\\n\\n- We\u2019ll collect community feedback until late June.\\n- If there\u2019s consensus, the 3-month trial begins July 1st.\\n- After the trial, we\u2019ll evaluate how it went and where to go next.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThank you again for being part of this journey. This community runs on trust, time, and care. With your feedback, we can keep building something that works \u2014 for all of us.\\n\\n[Discord]: https://discord.com/channels/937901803608096828/940290142579605514/1381286169601511515\\n[this form]: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGRK__pOmMja3y_GMmF7RbMjtnmebWrbXvY0JXstoiJLb7Uw/viewform?usp=dialog"},{"id":"release-25.6.1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-25.6.1","editUrl":"https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/tree/master/packages/docs/blog/2025-06-04-release-25-6-1.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-04-release-25-6-1.md","title":"Release 25.6.1","description":"New release of Actual.","date":"2025-06-04T10:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"announcement","permalink":"/blog/tags/announcement"},{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"}],"readingTime":0.45,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Matt Fiddaman","title":"Actual Budget Maintainer","url":"https://github.com/matt-fidd","imageURL":"/img/authors/matt-fidd.jpeg","key":"matt-fidd","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Release 25.6.1","description":"New release of Actual.","date":"2025-06-04T10:00","slug":"release-25.6.1","tags":["announcement","release"],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"authors":"matt-fidd"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Proposal for spending community funds","permalink":"/blog/spending-community-funds"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release 25.6.0","permalink":"/blog/release-25.6.0"}},"content":"This release contains the following improvements:\\n\\n- Ensures the server version is accurately displayed when deploying using Docker\\n- Fixes a rare crash when selecting dates\\n- Upgrades the Docker image to use Node.js version 20\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n**Docker tag: 25.6.1**\\n\\n#### Bugfix\\n\\n- [#5093](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/pull/5093) Fix server version display on docker images \u2014 thanks @MikesGlitch\\n- [#5095](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/pull/5095) Fix crash when datepicker deselected with no date set \u2014 thanks @matt-fidd\\n\\n#### Maintenance\\n\\n- [#5091](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/pull/5091) Update Dockerfiles to use Node.js 20 \u2014 thanks @matt-fidd"},{"id":"release-25.6.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-25.6.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/tree/master/packages/docs/blog/2025-06-03-release-25-6-0.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-03-release-25-6-0.md","title":"Release 25.6.0","description":"New release of Actual.","date":"2025-06-03T10:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"announcement","permalink":"/blog/tags/announcement"},{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"}],"readingTime":8.46,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Julian Dominguez-Schatz","title":"Actual Budget Maintainer","url":"https://github.com/jfdoming","imageURL":"/img/authors/jfdoming.jpeg","key":"jfdoming","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Release 25.6.0","description":"New release of Actual.","date":"2025-06-03T10:00","slug":"release-25.6.0","tags":["announcement","release"],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"authors":"jfdoming"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Release 25.6.1","permalink":"/blog/release-25.6.1"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release 25.5.0","permalink":"/blog/release-25.5.0"}},"content":"This release includes the ability to **run the sync server from within the desktop app**.

In this article - I recount my personal experience transitioning from YNAB to Actual and how I helped to build the community of volunteers. We also briefly talk about plans for 2025 and I address some frequent statements seen on the internet.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## My Journey to Actual Budget\\n\\nOver a decade ago I began my personal finance journey. Tried various different products and budgeting methodologies available at the time, but nothing really stuck. Until I found YNAB. Finally, something that helped me create and stick to a budget, and the community was really helpful as well. It felt great. I was one of their old-time customers on the \\"legacy\\" plan which did not see the price increases. That is - until 2021 when the trust of old-time customers was broken and we saw almost a 100% price increase. Even though the product was amazing - I could not justify spending as much of my disposable income on it. This made me look for alternatives.\\n\\nActual Budget enters the scene. In early 2022 James, the creator of Actual Budget, decided to close-down the commercial product and open source it. When I learned about this - I quickly jumped at the opportunity to transition to Actual before my YNAB subscription expired. Actual was not as feature-complete as YNAB, but it did the job for a fraction of the cost. It was a no-brainer for me.\\n\\nInitially there was a lot of buzz around Actual with developers and other folks quickly joining the project and helping out, but this initial push died down. The PRs were stuck waiting for a review for months with nobody around to review them. The Discord community slowly got less active. But - there was a small group of people that saw the tremendous value in this software.\\n\\nWe bonded together and convinced James to give us access to the core repositories. After that we were able to start reviewing and merging the backlog of all the PRs with bug-fixes and improvements. We had roughly 50 open PRs at that stage and my personal goal was to get it down to 20 and keep it there. I never reached this number as more PRs came in when the previous ones got closed. It\'s was both a blessing and a curse. The community was clearly eager to help out and improve the product, but reviewing all the changes was time-consuming.\\n\\nAt this stage I started building a bigger core maintainer team - recruiting some of the most active members of the community. There was no reward, no salary or benefits I could offer. But still - people were willing to volunteer their time, knowledge and experience to help build Actual. I am incredibly thankful and humbled by this.\\n\\nThe core team has been constantly changing and evolving. New folks join the team and help build the software; older team members leave as other things in their lives take priority (work, personal life, etc). However, the core principles of Actual have not changed since day 1.\\n\\nToday - the community discord has over 7\'000 members. We see thousands of users of Actual on PikaPods and upwards of a million docker container clones **per month**.\\n\\nI\'m happy to have led Actual to where it is today and I hope to remain a small part in its future too. In the short-term I will be taking a step back from actively leading the product due to a baby on the way. I\'m proud of the core maintainer team we have today and I am confident in their ability to run the product!\\n\\n## A look to the future\\n\\n2025 will be a very interesting year for Actual. There are many features in the works that will be released this year and with the growth trajectory of Actual - I\'m sure we will see many more. Including improvements to the existing systems: more features in mobile, improvements with tagging and filtering, more tailored dashboards and reports.\\n\\nSome of the bigger features coming in 2025 are:\\n\\n**Multi-user support**: running a single instance of Actual for your personal use is relatively easy. But what if you want to share it with your family members? So far the recommended approach was to create multiple budget files with different e2e encryption keys, but that is more of a workaround than a proper solution. In 2025 we plan on releasing a proper multi-user system that allows multiple people to use the same Actual instance.\\n\\n**OpenID authentication**: logging in with a password is clunky. Ideally you should be able to put Actual behind a 3rd party authentication protocol and use it as the login method. OpenID authentication support plans to address this. Currently an experimental feature and coming as a first-party feature in early 2025.\\n\\n**Translations:** a highly-requested feature - to allow translating Actual in Spanish, Portuguese, French and many other languages. The groundwork for the translation system has already been placed. Individual files are also slowly being moved over to be localized. You can follow the progress [here](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/issues/3329).\\n\\n**Plugin system:** by default we want to keep Actual rather minimalistic with an opinionated recommended budgeting approach. However, this does not fit everyone\'s needs. This is why I am particularly excited about a plugin system that would allow engineers from the community to write smaller extensions to Actual that can be easily installed. They change and/or extend the existing functionality to facilitate all sorts of edge-case behaviors that are not planed in the core offering.\\n\\nI\'m sure there will be many more great additions, but quite honestly - it\'s hard to say what exactly. It really is up to you - the community - to propose improvements and then also build them out. Me and the rest of the maintainer team are here to assist as best as we can.\\n\\n## Ps\\n\\nI see some comments on the internet that I would like to address in a unstructured way.\\n\\n**Is Actual Budget a competitor to YNAB?**\\n\\nPersonally: I don\'t see it that way. I have always spoken very fondly of YNAB. The software they have built is phenomenal. If I was much wealthier - I would definitely continue using it. However, I\'m not in such a position.\\n\\nAs such - I think even though Actual and YNAB both follow the envelope budgeting methodology - we cater to two different markets. And as such - I don\'t see us as \\"competing\\".\\n\\n**Is Actual Budget advertising on Reddit (or other platforms)?**\\n\\nNo.\\n\\n1. We do not make any money off of this - our work for Actual is charity\\n2. We do not intend to make money off of Actual\\n3. If you are still not convinced - please see the expenses in our [Open Collective] page - you will not find any advertisement expense there\\n\\n**Actual Budget is free**\\n\\nNot necessarily true. While the users of Actual might not need to pay to use the product - there is still a very high cost to it. It\'s just someone else paying the bill.\\n\\nAnd in this case the bill is not strictly monetary. Maintaining any piece of software is a very time and labor intensive work. So while it might be \\"free\\" for you to use - there are many invisible volunteers paying the cost with their time.\\n\\nWhich leads me to the next point: please show some appreciation to these folks.\\n\\n**Why was my Github issue closed?**\\n\\nMy philosophy to managing Actual has been quite simple: core maintainer time is limited. Thus - reducing the amount of distractions to the core maintainers takes priority.\\n\\n**How can I support the project?**\\n\\n1. contribute - fix issues, add features, write documentation, assist with support queries in discord, etc.\\n2. donate to the project via [Open Collective]\\n3. some of the core maintainers have github sponsors enabled if you want to buy a beer\\n\\n[Open Collective]: https://opencollective.com/actual"},{"id":"release-24.12.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-24.12.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/tree/master/packages/docs/blog/2024-12-05-release-24-12-0.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-05-release-24-12-0.md","title":"Release 24.12.0","description":"New release of Actual.","date":"2024-12-05T10:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"announcement","permalink":"/blog/tags/announcement"},{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"}],"readingTime":7.09,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Matt Fiddaman","title":"Actual Budget Maintainer","url":"https://github.com/matt-fidd","imageURL":"/img/authors/matt-fidd.jpeg","key":"matt-fidd","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Release 24.12.0","description":"New release of Actual.","date":"2024-12-05T10:00","slug":"release-24.12.0","tags":["announcement","release"],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"authors":"matt-fidd"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Roadmap for 2025","permalink":"/blog/roadmap-for-2025"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release 24.11.0","permalink":"/blog/release-24.11.0"}},"content":"The release has the following notable improvements:\\n\\n- Dashboards (also called Reports) officially released as first-party feature (for details see: https://actualbudget.org/docs/tour/reports)\\n- Tracking budget officially released as first-party feature (for details see https://actualbudget.org/docs/getting-started/tracking-budget)\\n- New summary report card type\\n- Batch sync for SimpleFin accounts\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n**Docker tag: 24.12.0**\\n\\n## Actual\\n\\n#### Features\\n\\n- [#3792](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/pull/3792) Add a summary card to report dashboard \u2014 thanks @lelemm\\n- [#3833](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/pull/3833) Release tracking budget feature. \u2014 thanks @MatissJanis\\n- [#3856](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/pull/3856) Dashboards: release as first party feature. \u2014 thanks @MatissJanis\\n\\n#### Enhancements\\n\\n- [#3381](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/pull/3381) Context menu\'s for transactions, budget, schedules, payees and rules pages \u2014 thanks @UnderKoen\\n- [#3581](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/pull/3581) Enable all SimpleFin accounts to be synced with a single request \u2014 thanks @matt-fidd\\n- [#3593](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/pull/3593) Refactored Sidebar components.

24.7.0","permalink":"/blog/release-24.7.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release 24.6.0","permalink":"/blog/release-24.6.0"}},"content":"Hello budgeters!\\n\\nThis is the start of the series **Actual Versus**!\\nToday we will be comparing Actual Budget to YNAB (You Need a Budget).\\n\\nYNAB is the longstanding heavyweight in the envelope budgeting space. It was one of the originals.\\nLets see how Actual stacks up!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nI will structure this comparison as follows.\\nFirst I will go over some of the fundamentals individually, then at the end have a quick comparison of some of the smaller features.\\nI will go in depth in the basics like how Actual is installed and run, how the budgeting basics compare, and then the other exciting features.\\nAlong with this blog post you can look around at our [documentation](../../docs), or our [main feature list](../../#features).\\n\\n### tl;dr\\n\\n- Actual uses **envelope budgeting**, same as YNAB.\\n- Actual is **free** for the base app and all updates. Hosting or optional bank syncing may have a fee depending on how you set up Actual.\\n- Actual can run on all devices **online or offline**, and can sync between devices if you set up a sync server.\\n- Your **data is yours** if you use Actual Budget, where with YNAB you have no control over your data\\n\\n## Running the Applications\\n\\nThis may be the place were Actual and YNAB are the most different.\\nYNAB is a service. This means that the user has minimal control over the application and data.\\nThis also means that YNAB owns your budget data. They say that they keep it safe, but that could change any time they want to.\\nBecause of this service model YNAB also has a continuing fee.\\nYour budgets are not available offline since you need to access YNAB\'s web page to see your budget.\\n\\nActual is Free and Open-Source.\\nThis means that there is no cost for the core software (extras like bank syncing may have a fee from the provider).\\nIf you don\'t want to use bank syncing, or it is not available in your region, there is no cost!\\nNo cost to download, no cost to use, no cost for updates.\\nYou are also free to modify the application in any way you want.\\n\\nBecause Actual is not a service we never see your budget data.\\nIt is controlled by you and it lives entirely on your devices and your server if you host one.\\nThis makes the data available offline since it is always on your device.\\n\\n### How to run Actual\\n\\nActual has a few options for running the software.\\nThe easiest to start is to install the desktop application or try [the web demo](https://app.actualbudget.org).\\nLong term you should consider also hosting your own sync server. Considerations for the sync server are added below.\\n\\n#### Desktop Application\\n\\nThe desktop application can be found at our [github release page](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/releases/latest).\\nDownload the file that matches your operating system.\\nThe `.exe` for Windows, the `.dmg` for Mac, or one of the Linux options.\\n\\n#### Web version\\n\\nYou can try out Actual using the [web demo](https://app.actualbudget.org) on any device.\\nThis link can be used long term if you are exclusively on mobile and don\'t have a sync server.\\nThe data will be stored on your device and we wont have any access to it.\\nIf you plan to do this make sure to export you data periodically as a backup (this can be done in the budget settings).\\nThe web version can be installed as an app for offline use.\\nThis can be found in your browser settings when viewing the web page.\\n\\n### Sync Server\\n\\nActual has two parts: the client (the stuff you see and interact with), and an optional sync server.\\nThe server is what allows syncing your budget file between devices and allows for bank syncing.\\nA full list of what does and does not require the sync server can be found [in this table](../../docs/install).\\nThe [docs page](../../docs/install) also includes information about options for hosting a sync server.\\n\\nThe quickest way to host a sync server is [to use PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/pods?run=actual).\\nPikaPods is a hosting service that costs just over one dollar a month to host a personal sync server[^1].\\nThis can be set up in minutes and provides a private sync server for your data, along with a copy of the web client for you to use on any device.\\nOther options include hosting your own with docker or node.js, or using some other hosting service.\\n\\n## Core Feature Comparison\\n\\n### Budgeting\\n\\nThe core budgeting style is where Actual and YNAB are the most similar.\\nBoth use envelope style budgeting, sometimes referred to zero-sum budgeting.\\nThis means that all your funds are assigned to categories, or \\"jobs\\" in YNAB vernacular.\\nThe budgeting styles are so similar you can [import your YNAB data into Actual](../../docs/migration) and move on like almost nothing changed.\\n\\nHow accounts and transactions are handled is very similar. There are transactions with payees, notes, categories, etc.\\nJust like you are used to.\\n\\nHere is a snippet of what Actual looks like in the budgeting view.\\nIts similar to YNAB, but each have a unique style.\\n\\n![](/img/homepage/actual-main-budget.png)\\n\\n#### Credit Cards\\n\\nThis is the one place where YNAB and Actual differ in budgeting.\\nYNAB automagically handles credit cards for you.\\nSome users prefer this approach while others find it annoying.\\n\\nThe way YNAB handles this can make it a bit too easy to hold onto credit card debt and let it build up.\\nActual needs some more deliberate handling of that debt.\\nOur docs [show how to do this in Actual](../../docs/budgeting/credit-cards).\\nThe tl;dr is that you put your existing debt in a category on your budget and any new debt has to be manually added into that category.\\nPrincipal and interest payments, get categorized into this category.\\nIf you use credit cards, but don\'t carry any debt, then don\'t worry, you don\'t have to do anything special.\\nEnvelope budgeting handles that process natively by using funds budgeted in your categories and paying off your balance.\\n\\n### Reports\\n\\nYNAB has a few simple reports but nothing especially exciting.\\nOn the other hand, Actual has built Net Worth and Cashflow reports and a full Custom Report engine for generating as many special purpose reports as you can think of.\\nWe have options for bar charts, line charts, area graphs, donut graphs, and data tables.\\nThese custom reports can be saved for later and get added to your personal report dashboard!\\nAll reports can be viewed on mobile.\\n\\nHere is an example of the kind of granularity you can achieve with these custom reports.\\nThis report is viewing how much was spent on food, by week, in both the `Food` and `Restaurant` categories over the last few months.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/actualvynab-report.png)\\n\\n### Bank Syncing\\n\\nActual currently has two bank sync providers with built in support.\\n\\nFor EU/UK users, Actual supports using Nordigen as a bank sync provider.\\nIt is free for banks and that market.\\n\\nFor North American banks, Actual has support for using SimpleFIN.\\nThis feature is still in an experimental state, but most users have had very good experiences with it.\\nSimpleFIN costs $1.50 per month, or $15 per year (at time of writing).\\n\\nFor other bank sync providers and other markets Actual has a JS API that can be used to create custom imports.\\nWe also would be open to any contributions that add new providers!\\n\\n### Goals and Budget Automation\\n\\nYNAB has revamped its targets in recent months.\\nThey are all a flavor of \\"save X funds every Y time period\\".\\nThis can cover many different situations pretty well.\\nYNAB does also have indicator bars to show if the goal has been met, or progress towards that goal.\\n\\nActual currently is developing a feature that is similar to YNAB\'s targets we refer to as goal templates.\\nGoal templates is more flexible and has more options than YNAB\'s targets.\\nA full write up of how they work can be found in the [Goal Templates Documentation](../../docs/experimental/goal-templates).\\nSome notable goals that Actual has would be: goals based on scheduled expenses, percentage goals, remainder goals, and much more!\\n\\nOne big difference from YNAB to Actual currently is that in Actual goals are indicated as met or not on a monthly basis instead of a total basis.\\nThis means that if you have a multi month goal to save $500 in the next 10 months, Actual would give you a met indication if you budget $50.\\nIf you budget more than you needed, the goal will adjust each month so that the amount you need in the current month is always accurate.\\nHere is an example of what these indications looks like for a goal met(green), goal incomplete(yellow), or overspent(red) category.\\n\\n![](/img/goal-template/templates-colors.png)\\n\\nThese goals can also be used to automate your budgeting each month, same as YNAB.\\nOne extra feature that YNAB does not have with their goals is the ability to prioritize certain categories.\\nThis makes it so the goal templates can be used to budget everything automatically.\\nThere are a few blog posts about using these templates.\\nOne about budgeting all [categories using priorities](./2023-12-15-automate.md).\\nAnd another for [weekly based budgeting](./2024-03-25-automate-twist.md).\\n\\nGoal templates is under active development so expect it to be even better as time goes on!\\n\\n### Other Features\\n\\nThis will be a rapid fire view of feature comparison. For a full view of these features you can read up [in our documentation](../../docs).\\nDon\'t worry the docs aren\'t too long to read. I will also be including the already mentioned features.\\n\\n| Feature                | Actual |  YNAB   |                                                                    Notes                                                                    |\\n| :--------------------- | :----: | :-----: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\\n| Cost                   |  FREE  | $109/yr |         The base application of Actual is free. This does not include if you choose to use a hosting service or bank sync provider          |\\n| Works On All Devices   |   \u2705   |   \u2705    |              Actual is still in the process of reaching full feature parity between mobile and desktop, but it is nearly there              |\\n| Desktop App            |   \u2705   |   \u274c    |                                            Actual includes automated backups in the desktop app                                             |\\n| You Own Your Data      |   \u2705   |   \u274c    |                                   Actual can\'t see your data since it never leaves you devices or server                                    |\\n| Offline Use            |   \u2705   |   \u274c    |                                                                                                                                             |\\n| Sync Between Devices   |   \u2705   |   \u2705    |                          Requires a server for Actual to sync between devices, where YNAB has this out of the box                           |\\n| Envelope Budgeting     |   \u2705   |   \u2705    |                                                                                                                                             |\\n| Traditional Budgeting  |   \u2705   |   \u274c    |             Actual does have the option for a non-envelope style budget, but we think you should stick with envelope budgeting              |\\n| Multiple budget files  |   \u2705   |   \u2705    |                                                                                                                                             |\\n| Dark Theme             |   \u2705   |   \u2705    |                            Actual has two dark themes.

YNAB only supports North America while Actual supports both North America and Europe and requires a sync server |\\n| Open Source            |   \u2705   |   \u274c    |                                                                                                                                             |\\n| Transaction Rules      |   \u2705   |   \u2705    |                   YNAB is limited to just rules to modify the payee, while Actual\'s Rules can modify much more if desired                   |\\n| Custom Reports         |   \u2705   |   \u274c    |                                                                                                                                             |\\n| Flexible Goals         |   \u2705   |   \u2705    |                               Actual has more options for Goals but less in the way of goal status indication                               |\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI hope this comparison was useful to those considering the two budgeting apps.\\nThe two apps are different and have their own pros and cons.\\n\\nIf you would like a different perspective, from a recent YNAB user, check out [this write up](https://samw.dev/2024/07/01/actual-for-ynab.html).\\nIt goes in depth on some of the differences between the two applications and some benefits, drawbacks, and considerations if someone were to migrate from YNAB to Actual.\\n\\n[^1] A portion of the cost to host on PikaPods is donated to the Actual Budget Project.

If you haven\'t read it yet, you might want to start [here](/blog/2023-12-15-automate.md). While we always recommend embracing the envelope system and [getting a month ahead](/blog/2023-12-15-automate.md#month-ahead) on your budget, there are some situations where that just isn\'t possible right away. I\'m going to introduce a method here that uses the goal template system that uses your income as you receive it throughout the month using priorities.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n# The Scenario\\n\\nGoal templates are an experimental feature within Actual that allow you to auto-budget categories. You can set goals that can be once off or repeating with scheduling options that are very flexible. To see more about this feature in detail, you can check out the [documentation](../../docs/experimental/goal-templates) page. To enable this feature, navigate to the settings page and scroll down and click the link to expose Experimental features within the Advanced settings area. In the mean time, you can read more about a specific use case using goal templates for weekly budgeting.\\n\\nIn this scenario, my income will be $500 per week, starting on the first of the month. I have certain priorities that need to be met. For example, I like to eat so I\'m going to prioritize food for the first pay period. I\'m going to set up my mortgage to be paid at the end of the month, saving a little each week. I\'m going to budget for several bills that happen throughout the month where I know which week they\'ll need to be paid. I\'m also going to use a simple template with priorities to illustrate this method. Feel free to use other template types.\\n\\nPriorities allow you to decide which goals are funded first. Check out our last [blog post](/blog/2023-12-15-automate.md#how-priorities-work) or the section in the [documentation](../../docs/experimental/goal-templates#template-priorities) that explains in much greater detail on how to use them. In this example, I\'ve decided to use the following priority levels\\n\\n- Week 1: 10-19\\n- Week 2: 20-29\\n- Week 3: 30-39\\n- Week 4: 40-49\\n- 50+ for any additional priorities that can be funded after my monthly priorities are satisfied. This includes long term goals like vacation savings, investments, or holiday spending.\\n\\nIn week 1, level 10 will run first, level 11 second, level 12 third, and so on. This strategy allows me to have different priorities within each week if I want. Since I\'ve decided week 2 priorities will start at 20, all week 1 goals will be funded before week 2, and all of week 2 will be funded before week 3.\\n\\n| Category          |                                                  How much I need per week, and when                                                   |                         Template used for the category                          |\\n| :---------------- | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\\n| **Food**          |                                                       $50 per week, every week                                                        | #template-10 50<br/> #template-20 50<br/> #template-30 50<br/> #template-40 50  |\\n| **Restaurants**   | $25 per week, every week.

When the goal templates are applied, the categories will be filled in the following order. I\'ve bolded the categories that will only be filled for certain periods. When the templates are applied, the categories will be filled in order. Week 1 priorities will be filled first, followed by week 2 and so forth. The lower the priority number in the template from the table above, the earlier that goal will be filled.\\n\\n| First week                                                                                                              | Second week                                                                                           | Third week                                                                                            | Fourth week                                                                                         | Leftovers                         |\\n| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |\\n| 1.

For each week I receive new income, I reapply the templates. You\'ll see that each of my categories gets filled a little more each time. If I have a little extra from one week, it will start filling up the categories for the next weeks goals. When I receive my final pay in the fourth week, my final two categories receive some funding.\\n\\nThis approach fills your budget categories as your income arrives by prioritizing your needs and allows you to spend from your categories along the way.\\n\\n### Week 1, Receive first income deposit\\n\\nNow that we have our first deposit for the month, we\'re ready to start budgeting using templates.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/twist-1.png)\\n\\n### Week 1, Apply budget templates\\n\\nUse the **Apply budget template** menu option in the monthly menu. Open the menu by clicking on the three vertical dots to the right of the month.\\n\\nNotice that both Food, Power, and Cell categories have received funding greater than expected this week. The templates are already funding goals for week 2! Only half ($75) of the desired power budget ($150) is satisfied and was the last category to receive funding. It\'ll be the first category in the next pay period to be filled. Feel free to refer back to the table above to see which categories are being filled. There is a lot happening here.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/twist-2.png)\\n\\n### Receive second week\'s income and \'Overwrite with budget templates\'\\n\\nFor each time going forward, we\'re going to use the **Overwrite with budget template** button in the month\'s menu. We do this because we already have a budget filled out. This will force the templates to replace any budgeted values already filled.\\n\\nNotice that week 3 goals are already being funded. Most of the categories still show a yellow indicator. This means that they still need more funding this month to reach all of your goals. If they have turned green, like General, Cell, and Power, the target goal has been reached.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/twist-3.png)\\n\\n### Receive third week\'s income and \'Overwrite with budget templates\'\\n\\nMore green category balances! Keep in mind, you can spend from these categories along the way. I simply didn\'t show any spending in these graphics.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/twist-4.png)\\n\\n### Receive fourth week\'s income and \'Overwrite with budget templates\'\\n\\nThis is the final pay period for the month.

do!\\nAs a new year is approaching so is the goal-setting and reflection season.\\nI\'m hoping to help some of you with potential new years resolutions by making budgeting as easy as possible while still reaching for your goals.\\nI believe that Actual is a great tool for this whether you have a simple budget or a complex one.\\n\\nOne hurdle that many have with budgeting is that it takes constant effort to stay up to date.\\nEntering transactions, assigning categories, reconciling with your bank and others can hold us back.\\nI hope to give you some pointers and strategies today to reduce some of the stress of budgeting by streamlining the budgeting processes with goal templates.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nI\'ve been using Actual for a while now.\\nIn that time I have become very familiar with the goal template feature and would like to share with you how I use the goal templates in hopes that it will help inspire you.\\nI use goal templates to budget all of my paycheck for me.\\nAll I need is a few seconds, a few clicks, and my budget for the month is done.\\nI only budget what I have, nothing more.\\nThe goal templates can dynamically fill categories that have more need, and skip ones that are filled.\\nThe goal template feature is incredibly flexible and you can cater them to your situation.\\nChances are good that you can leverage it in some way to speed up your budgeting, or to meet your budgeting goals.\\n\\n### My Goals and Strategies\\n\\nAs we go along I will be showing how I use goal templates to meet my budget goals without having to fuss over what to put where.\\nThe high level of these goals are to follow the **Month Ahead** strategy and the **Pay Yourself First** strategy.\\nI also have some side savings goals such as funds for home maintenance that I budget for.\\nI am able to meet all of these with minimal continuing effort because my monthly financial goals are baked into the goal templates I use\\n\\nBelow I give a brief overview of these strategies, and a introduction to goal templates.\\nIf you are familiar with those you can skip to [my budget examples](#how-i-budget)\\n\\n#### Month Ahead\\n\\nThis one is really straight forward.\\nThis means that all the money you are spending _this_ month was money you earned _last_ month.\\nActual makes this pretty simple already, by allowing the user to \\"hold\\" funds for the next month.\\nWhat Actual doesn\'t do for you is budget those funds, and that is where the goal templates come in.\\n\\nIt may take some time to work yourself up to this if you are currently living paycheck-to-paycheck.\\nThat\'s okay, Actual is here to help you forward and has the tools you need to accomplish that!\\n\\n#### Pay Yourself First\\n\\nThe idea with pay yourself first is that you are prioritizing saving and investing over spending.\\nTo achieve this you do need to first have a decent idea of what your base spending is.\\nIf you have a good feel for what you **need** then you can start pushing yourself on how much you can **save**.\\nMy current goal is to save 30% of my monthly, after tax income.\\nThat is aggressive, so don\'t feel like you need to be that high.\\nIts pretty common to shoot for 10-20%, but do what _you_ can.\\nAny savings is better than nothing.\\nThe reason behind this is to push yourself to not spend what you could be saving by deliberately saving first.\\n\\nHow the pay yourself first strategy is implemented is pretty simple: **you pay yourself before you pay others**!\\nIn more specific terms, you pull money out of your paycheck for savings before you spend or allocate any on bills and fun things.\\nIn the context of a budget this can be achieved by allocating savings first, then allocating the rest to everything else.\\nI\'ll show you how the goal templates make this super easy.\\n\\n## Goal Templates\\n\\nAt time of writing the goal template feature is experimental.\\nThat is primarily because the maintainers would like there to be a GUI to create the goals before fully releasing the feature.\\n\\nThe goal templates allow you to tell Actual a set of rules and priorities so Actual can budget for you.\\nIsn\'t that awesome!\\nNo more manually assigning categories, unless you want to, of course.\\n\\nYou create a template by adding a line to your category note that looks something like `#template up to 50`.\\nThe `#template` at the start is how Actual finds your template to know what you want to do.\\nI\'ll outline a few of the templates I find most useful here, but I recommend you read through the full [goal template docs page](../../docs/experimental/goal-templates).\\n\\n#### Simple\\n\\nThis is the most basic template.\\nIt will budget the amount you tell it to.\\nSimple!\\n\\nIf you want to budget $50 use: `#template $50`.\\n\\nIf you want to budget $1050 use: `#template $1050`.\\n\\nA slightly more advanced option would be if you want to make sure you have $100 in your category, but might have some leftover from last month and not need to add the full $100 this month.\\nYou can do this by using `up to` like: `#template up to $100`.\\n\\n#### Schedule\\n\\nIf you have taken the time to curate a list of schedules of expected transactions, you can automate budgeting them with the schedule template.\\n\\nAn example would look like `#template schedule Rent`.\\n\\nThis will automatically budget the money you need to pay your rent based on your `Rent` schedule.\\n\\n#### Percentage\\n\\nSay you want to budget a percent of your income, or a percent of what you have available.\\nThis is useful for savings, or to keep fun spending within a limit.\\nSome examples of this are:\\n\\n- `#template 10% of all income` to budget 10% of all income categories.\\n- `#template 10% of Paycheck` to only include the \\"Paycheck\\" category in the calculation.\\n\\n### Template Priorities\\n\\nOkay, so you understand the templates pretty well now.\\nNow for, in my opinion, the most useful part of templates.\\nWe can set priorities!\\nSetting a priority to the templates does two things for us\\n\\n1. It tells Actual to not budget more money then shows in your `To Budget`. This is not the case by default.\\n2. It tells Actual in what order to apply the templates.\\n\\nSo now, if we use priorities, we can entirely automate the distribution of funds both in a set order, and only what we have.\\nIsn\'t that awesome!\\n\\n#### How Priorities Work\\n\\nPriorities are processed in numerical order, so 1 first, then 2, then 3, and so on.\\nYou can think of the priority value as which pass does this template get run.\\nIf the priority is 1, the template gets processed on template pass 1.\\nIf the priority is 7, that template gets processed on template pass 7.\\nFeel free to space out the numbers, Actual will skip priority values that don\'t have any templates defined.\\nThis way it takes the same amount of time to process templates with priorities of 1 and 2, as it will to process templates with priorities of 7 and 10000.\\nThe order is the thing that matters most when setting the priority values.\\n\\nTemplates with priorities look like this: `#template-10 schedule Rent`.\\nWhere this has a priority level of 10.\\n\\n## How I Budget\\n\\nNow that we have the needed background knowledge, I will walk through my workflow each month and examples of the templates I use.\\nMy setup is designed to require the least effort possible on my part to start the month.\\nCurrently I budget all of my available funds with a single click.\\nAll the categories that I normally would budget for get handled when I click the \\"Apply Budget Templates\\" button.\\n\\n### Preparation and Setting Up Month Ahead\\n\\nDuring the month, when my paychecks come in, I \\"hold\\" my income for the next month.\\nThis way I know that I am staying within my goal of being a month ahead.\\n\\nI also have a few `#cleanup` templates.\\nThis isn\'t necessary if you don\'t want to worry about it.\\nIf you are interested you can read the [end of month cleanup docs page](../../docs/experimental/monthly-cleanup).\\n\\n### Paying Myself first\\n\\nThe highest priority templates that I have are in my savings category.\\nThey are:\\n\\n- `#template 30% of previous Paycheck`\\n- `#template 30% of previous Dividends`\\n\\nI call out these two income categories specifically because I have other income categories that I don\'t want to get used here.\\nBy calling out the specific income categories I do want, I exclude those others.\\nBut wait, _what is that \\"previous\\" keyword?_ you may be asking.\\nUsing the \\"previous\\" keyword tells Actual to not use this month\'s income, but to use _last_ month\'s income.\\nThis is how I can use both pay yourself first AND month ahead together within the template structure.\\nYou could also consider something like `#template 30% of available funds`, but that includes things like rollover, which I don\'t want here.\\n\\nBecause these templates don\'t have a priority they get set to priority 0 by default.\\nThis means they will be run first, thus meeting my goal of saving before allocating any other funds.\\nYou could use priority 1 and get the same effect while also protecting against over budgeting, but it doesn\'t make a difference in my workflow.\\nI will always have enough funds for this because I held all of my paycheck forward so it is available in the same month as these templates are run.\\n\\n### Covering My Needs\\n\\nAfter I have pulled out what I want to save, I move next to my base needs.\\nThis covers my mortgage, groceries, utilities and such.\\nHere are some of the template I use for this:\\n\\n- `#template-1 schedule Mortgage` in my Mortgage category\\n- `#template-10 400 up to 700` in my Groceries category\\n\\nAll my other needs categories are some flavor of these two basic templates.\\nI use priority 1 for my mortgage because its the most important thing, then I use priority 10 for all my other needs level templates.\\nYou don\'t need to space your priorities out like this.\\nI do it so if I ever decide to add new categories in between, or feel the need to be more granular with my ordering, I have space and don\'t need to shift all of my templates to have space.\\n\\nThe mortgage category will get budgeted to what I need to cover the payment for that month.\\nMy groceries category will normally budget $400, but I include the \\"up to\\" keyword to not accidentally build up funds here.\\nThis helps handle month to month variation in stride without needing to move money around on months that happened to have more trips to the store.\\nIf I happened to build up a lot more than 400 the template won\'t ever allow there to be more than 700 available to start the month.\\nIf something crazy happens and I get a big refund or similar that goes back into the grocery category, then the template will remove the extra funds.\\n\\n#### Potential issue\\n\\nThe schedule templates have an extra consideration for an automated budget.\\nWhen your schedule has a varying amount and is defined by an amount range instead of a specific amount each month, you can under budget.\\nThe schedule template will budget the average of the high and low bounds on your schedule amount.\\nThis gives the possibility of under budgeting, potentially by a lot, if you have a large amount range.\\nYou also can over budget, but that\'s usually not as much of an issue as under budgeting.\\nOne way I have used to get around this is to use a simple template that budgets a value at, or near, the upper limit of your schedule.\\nIt may just be a simple as `#template-10 75`.\\nThis can be used in conjunction with a `#cleanup` template to automate removing extra funds at the end of the month if you would like.\\n\\n### Sinking Funds and Miscellaneous Categories\\n\\nNow that the most important expenses are handled, we get to the messy middle categories.\\nThese categories get used semi-regularly, but start to straddle the line between needs and wants.\\nThese types of categories are also where the strengths of envelope budgeting become apparent.\\nThis stage is where we can get really creative with templates to determine what we want to budget first and what gets the leftovers.\\nThere are lots of interesting template strategies to try out that I haven\'t gone over yet, such as \\"by\\" style, repeating templates, and multiple templates in a single category with different priority levels.\\n\\n#### Sinking Funds\\n\\nIn my system my next priority is sinking funds.\\nA sinking fund is a category that purposefully builds up funds for either emergencies or irregular expenses.\\nThis could be something like car maintenance that we all know is needed, but can show up unplanned.\\nFor this type of category I use a template like:\\n\\n- `#template-30 50 up to 1000` in my Auto Maintenance category\\n- `#template-30 100 up to 2500` in my Home Maintenance category\\n\\nThe strategy here is to slowly build up funds, but not allow more that I want.\\nIf I reach the limit, Actual will not add anymore and I have more available for fun categories.\\n\\n#### Other Categories\\n\\nThe next set of categories are a bit tricky.\\nThere is no reason I couldn\'t use the same strategy as used with the sinking funds, but I don\'t really want much sitting in these funds.\\nI only want money in them if I need it.\\n\\nThe strategy I have landed on is to only fund one \\"Misc Expenses\\" category that is a catch all for things like clothes, personal care, gifts, etc.\\nI set the goal in my \\"Misc Expenses\\" category to `#template-40 up to 200\\"`.\\nThe idea is that this is enough for the other things that have their own category, but don\'t get used super often.\\nIf I spend for those categories, I transfer what I need from the funds available in \\"Misc Expenses\\" and call it a day.\\nI can also directly categorize transactions in this \\"Misc\\" category if that makes the most sense.\\n\\n### Fun Categories\\n\\nAt this point the only things left are fun categories.\\nSince I know that I have already allocated towards savings, and all the needed things, I have a green light to spend the remainder on more fun things.\\nMy base fun category is creatively named \\"Fun Money\\".\\nIn this category I use `#template-50 150`.\\n\\nIf you have nothing else after this that you would like to budget for, you could also use `#template-50 remainder`.\\nThe \\"remainder\\" key word tells Actual to dump everything left in your To Budget into this category.\\nThe remainder can be used in multiple categories if you would like to split the remaining funds between a few fun categories.\\nOr you could drop the remaining funds into your savings category to save even more!\\n\\nAnother strategy that you could employ with leftover funds is to circle back to a previously budgeted category and add more to it.\\nFor example I have a sinking fund that I would like to budget more to if I have leftover funds available after my base fun money is budgeted.\\nTo do this I have two template lines at different priorities.\\nIt looks like:\\n\\n- `#template-30 100 up to 1500`\\n- `#template-60 100 up to 1500`\\n\\nThis adds 100 to this category on the first pass and will happen before my fun categories.\\nIt then gets a second chance to add more after my fun categories by having a higher priority level.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWith this strategy for goal templates, starting a new month budget takes just a few seconds.\\nThe continuing effort is mostly limited to monitoring that transactions are correct (I use bank syncing to reduce there work there).\\nThis way I can spend my time and effort doing budget analysis over keeping it up to date.\\n\\nI hope that there was something in here that was useful to you in your budgeting journey.\\nThe goal template system is meant to be flexible enough to work with your budgeting style.\\nI didn\'t get to my system overnight.\\nExperiment and figure out what makes sense to you.\\nMaybe you want to automate some things and not others.\\nMaybe you want to be granular down to the penny.\\nThese, and everything in between, are possible with some effort.\\n\\nI wish you all a merry holiday season and a happy new year!\\n\\nHappy budgeting"},{"id":"release-23.12.1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-23.12.1","editUrl":"https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/tree/master/packages/docs/blog/2023-12-07-release-23.12.1.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-07-release-23.12.1.md","title":"Release
