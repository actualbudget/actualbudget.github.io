            <description><![CDATA[The new home for the Open Source project.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As some of you may have noticed a lot of the URL's for our documentation, official test instance of Actual Budget and other parts of the project have silently been changing over the last few days, we can now give you an update on why, we have taken the decision to move everything relating to the Open Source version of Actual Budget to <a href="https://actualbudget.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">actualbudget.org</a> and this takes effect across the project with immediate effect, some of the changes you will see include;</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Our website for Actual Budget Open Source is now available at <a href="https://actualbudget.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://actualbudget.org</a></li>
<li class="">Documentation now lives at <a href="https://actualbudget.org/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://actualbudget.org/docs</a></li>
<li class="">Our demo instance of actual can be found at <a href="https://demo.actualbudget.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://demo.actualbudget.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The website is powered by the same static site generator as the documentation, in fact it is the same instance, we have added a custom home page allowing us to continue using Docusaurus as our static site generator, the great thing about this is that is keeps everything Open Source, including all the blog posts.</p>
<p>Talking of the blog, this change will introduce a blog feed, you can find that <a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/rss.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">here</a> if you are looking for posts specific to releases you can have a look at the <a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/tags/release" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">release tag</a> historical releases will be added as posts over the coming days.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Actual Budgeters!
Another year has gone by with many fixes and upgrades to Actual.
Let's look back over the year and also look at what's to come.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="2025-in-review">2025 in review<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/roadmap-for-2026#2025-in-review" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2025 in review" title="Direct link to 2025 in review" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>It's always fun to look back and see all the progress made in Actual over the course of a year.
It's easy to forget how many of the features we love weren't available back at the beginning of the year.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="new-features">New features<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/roadmap-for-2026#new-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New features" title="Direct link to New features" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>My favorites in approximately chronological order are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">OIDC and multi-user support</li>
<li class="">Adjustable upcoming time frame for schedules</li>
<li class="">Multiple new report types</li>
<li class="">NPM package for the sync server</li>
<li class="">Translations</li>
<li class="">Bank sync management page</li>
<li class="">Desktop app improvements such as the embedded server</li>
<li class="">Auto-hold income</li>
<li class="">Merge transactions</li>
<li class="">Transaction tags</li>
<li class="">Mobile pages for Rules, Payees, Schedules, and Bank Sync</li>
<li class="">Budget Currencies (still experimental)</li>
<li class="">Quickly add single schedules from the account view</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note on Translations:</strong>  Translations are a never-ending project.
Every month there are new or modified strings that need to be translated.
We could use as many contributors to translation as we can get.
If you are interested in helping translate Actual into other languages see <a href="https://actualbudget.org/docs/contributing/i18n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">our translation guide</a>.</p>
<p>If you remember our roadmap from last year, you will see that we were able to accomplish all but one of our goals, plugins.
I will touch on that more below.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="maintainer-and-contributor-payments">Maintainer and contributor payments<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/roadmap-for-2026#maintainer-and-contributor-payments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Maintainer and contributor payments" title="Direct link to Maintainer and contributor payments" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This year we started paying small stipends to the core maintainer team, and giving out SWAG items to other contributors.
The maintainer stipends are based on points received for doing the necessary, but not very exciting, parts of maintaining Actual.
This is only possible because of the generous donations from you the users.
Many of you donate regularly and there are over 8000 Pikapods users whose hosting fees partially go towards supporting Actual.
We offer a very hearty thank you to those who are donating.
See the bottom of the post for ways to support the project if you would like to donate.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="2026-wish-list">2026 Wish list<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/roadmap-for-2026#2026-wish-list" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2026 Wish list" title="Direct link to 2026 Wish list" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Plugins</strong>: We have been working on adding plugins to allow users to more easily add functionality to the app without the need to add said feature to the base app.
The feature is not quite ready as plugins have a tendency to break existing features, which slows down development a great deal.
We are doing everything we can to not break existing features that we know you rely on.
Our hope is to have plugins ready for you to build on in the first few months of 2026.</p>
<p>The first plugins we will be adding will be to migrate the existing bank sync providers.
We also are looking at adding multiple new providers soon after.
Multiple prospective providers have reached out to us in just the last few months and are patiently waiting for plugins before fully integrating into Actual.</p>
<p><strong>Goals UI</strong>: The goal templates and cleanup templates experimental features are used by many, if not most of you.
We plan on getting a proper GUI put together for these to make adding and editing templates less prone to error.
This would also include the ability to predict the total needed to meet all set budget goals, see all active goals, and easily modify fill order.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile view feature parity</strong>: The mobile view has received many updates this year but it still lacks a number of features that are available on desktop.  We would like to bring that disparity down to close to 0 this year.</p>
<p><strong>Rewrite the transaction table</strong>:  The transaction table is probably the most important feature of the app, even more so than the budget itself.
The code for the transaction table is complicated, and not conducive to new features.
We plan to rewrite this code to be more maintainable, more accessible to new contributors, and more extendable for new features such as resizing columns.</p>
<p><strong>Debt account type</strong>: Currently Actual only has a standard account, you can add transactions and there is a balance.
This is perfect for checking and savings accounts, but less great for loans.
We would like to bring back account types to make more specialty type accounts easier to manage in Actual, starting with loan accounts.
The ability to automate this is technically already available with rules and schedules, but adding in a custom account type that does the setup for you would be that much better.
We will look at what other account types would make sense for the base app, but with plugins the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p><strong>Better and faster code tests</strong>: We have stared work on upgrading our CI/CD to use Rust based tooling.
This speeds up the tests immensely and makes development and testing faster.</p>
<p>(Remember to vote on the features you would like to see get added to Actual.

<p>Thank you all that contribute!
Whether that be through donations, bug reporting, code submissions, documentation edits, or helping on discord, Actual wouldn't exist without you.</p>
<p>Happy Budgeting and have a happy new year!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actual has started receiving what can only be described as <em>AI slop</em> — pull requests and issues generated entirely by automated systems with no human involvement. These require the same amount of triage and review time as genuine contributions, but add no value. Every minute spent dealing with machine-generated junk is time not spent improving Actual itself.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="the-problem">The Problem<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/fighting-ai-slop#the-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Problem" title="Direct link to The Problem" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>To be clear: AI is a useful tool. We use it ourselves to draft code, fix bugs, and build features. Heck - even this article was written with the assistance of AI. But the difference is that a human is always in charge. We review, test, and take responsibility for what we merge. What we are seeing now is the opposite — unreviewed output blindly pushed upstream (i.e. opened as PRs or issues). That is not contribution; it's pollution.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="our-policy">Our Policy<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/fighting-ai-slop#our-policy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our Policy" title="Direct link to Our Policy" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>From this point on, we will close any PRs or issues that appear to be 100% AI-generated with no sign of human oversight. This isn't about being harsh, it's about protecting the limited time our maintainers have to review genuine contributions.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/fighting-ai-slop#why-this-matters" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why This Matters" title="Direct link to Why This Matters" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Every AI slop PR or issue requires the same triage and review time as genuine contributions. With limited maintainer bandwidth, this directly impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Response times for real issues and feature requests</li>
<li class="">Time available for reviewing legitimate contributions</li>
<li class="">Overall project velocity</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to spend our time improving Actual, not filtering through automated noise.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="how-to-contribute-properly-with-ai">How to Contribute Properly with AI<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/fighting-ai-slop#how-to-contribute-properly-with-ai" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Contribute Properly with AI" title="Direct link to How to Contribute Properly with AI" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>If you're using AI to help with contributions, that's perfectly fine! Just make sure you:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Review everything</strong> before submitting, understand what changed and why</li>
<li class=""><strong>Test your changes</strong> - don't assume AI-generated code works correctly</li>
<li class=""><strong>Respond to feedback</strong> - be ready to discuss, iterate, and improve your contribution</li>
<li class=""><strong>Take responsibility</strong> - you're the one submitting it, so make sure it's something you stand behind</li>
<li class=""><strong>Tag them with "ai generated"</strong> (This isn't something we can truly enforce, but it's a gesture of good will — it helps everyone in the review process know when AI was involved.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details on how to contribute, see our <a class="" href="https://actualbudget.org/docs/contributing/">contributing guidelines</a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="a-silver-lining">A Silver Lining<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/fighting-ai-slop#a-silver-lining" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Silver Lining" title="Direct link to A Silver Lining" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>One small silver lining: our "WIP" (Work-In-Progress) workflow — which requires contributors to manually remove the "WIP" prefix before a PR can be reviewed — has proven effective at filtering out AI bots. It's an unintentional captcha we have built. Many of them can't complete that simple step, so their PRs go stale and close automatically.</p>
<p>Even so, it would be better not to receive AI slop at all.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="keep-it-human">Keep It Human<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/fighting-ai-slop#keep-it-human" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Keep It Human" title="Direct link to Keep It Human" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Please, if you're using AI to help contribute, stay in the loop. Review, edit, and understand what you're submitting. Actual is built by humans, for humans. Keep it that way.</p>
<p>We're grateful for all genuine contributions, whether AI-assisted or not. The key is human oversight and understanding. Thank you for helping keep Actual focused on what matters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Our 3-month trial of paying core maintainers has been a success. We're making it permanent — and will be expanding the system to cover bug bounties, feature work, and more.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="" href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/spending-community-funds">Three months ago</a>, we launched an experiment: using community donations to directly support the people who keep this project running. The idea was simple — compensate core contributors for the invisible but essential work of reviewing pull requests, triaging issues, and preparing releases.</p>
<p>Today, we're excited to share that the trial has been a success. 🎉</p>
<p>Thanks to your feedback, patience, and ongoing support, we've ironed out the kinks in the system, resolved bugs in the points tracking process, and proven that this model is both fair and sustainable.</p>
<p>As a result: <strong>we're making contributor payments permanent.</strong></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="what-this-means">What This Means<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/continuing-to-reward-contributors#what-this-means" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What This Means" title="Direct link to What This Means" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li class="">Core contributors will continue to receive stipends based on their monthly contributions.</li>
<li class="">The transparent points system (for PR reviews, issue triage, and releases) remains in place.</li>
<li class="">Funding continues to come from our community donations on <a href="https://opencollective.com/actual" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">OpenCollective</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures that the essential maintenance work — the work that enables everything else to happen — is recognized and supported long-term.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="whats-next-expanding-the-system">What's Next: Expanding the System<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/continuing-to-reward-contributors#whats-next-expanding-the-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's Next: Expanding the System" title="Direct link to What's Next: Expanding the System" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The initial trial was focused on core maintenance. Now that the foundation is solid, we're preparing to expand. Over the coming months, we plan to introduce:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Bug bounties</strong> → Rewards for fixing long-standing or high-impact issues.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Feature bounties</strong> → Incentives for implementing important improvements requested by the community.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Other initiatives</strong> → Ways to make contributing more rewarding and sustainable for everyone, not just core maintainers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll share details about these expansions soon — so stay tuned!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="thank-you-️">Thank You ❤️<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/continuing-to-reward-contributors#thank-you-%EF%B8%8F" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Thank You ❤️" title="Direct link to Thank You ❤️" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>This project is powered by generosity, trust, and shared care. By supporting contributors financially, we're not just sustaining the software — we're sustaining the community behind it.</p>
<p>To everyone who has donated, given feedback, or contributed time and energy: thank you. This is your success as much as ours.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our open source community has reached an exciting point: thanks to the incredible generosity of our donors, we now have a steady flow of funds coming in. First of all — thank you.</p>
<p>This support allows us to make the project more sustainable for everyone involved. We want to start by addressing something that is often overlooked in open source: the invisible labor that keeps everything running.</p>
<p>We're proposing a 3-month trial program to pay our core maintainers for the essential (but often unglamorous) work of:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Reviewing pull requests</li>
<li class="">Triage and categorize GitHub issues</li>
<li class="">Preparing releases</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe it's time to recognize the financial value of labor — but before we move forward, we want to hear your feedback. Join the conversation on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/937901803608096828/940290142579605514/1381286169601511515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Discord</a> or leave anonymous feedback in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGRK__pOmMja3y_GMmF7RbMjtnmebWrbXvY0JXstoiJLb7Uw/viewform?usp=dialog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">this form</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> This proposal has been approved. More details about the payment system can be found in the <a class="" href="https://actualbudget.org/docs/contributing/leadership/paying-contributors">paying contributors</a> page.</p>

<p>Starting July 1st, we'd like to set aside $1,000 per month from the project's funds for a review stipend pool. This pool would be divided between <strong>core maintainers</strong> based on the work they do each month, measured via a transparent points system.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Points are assigned based on the size of PRs reviewed (using lines of code as a proxy for effort).</li>
<li class="">Additional points are awarded for labelling and grooming issues, closing duplicates, and managing releases.</li>
<li class="">The system has a cap, and in months with less activity, the payout is reduced to $500.</li>
<li class="">Payments are handled via OpenCollective and are only available to core maintainers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This system is designed to be lightweight, fair, and easy to administer — and it keeps our monthly costs well within our donation income.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="why-start-with-admin-work">Why Start With Admin Work?<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/spending-community-funds#why-start-with-admin-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Start With Admin Work?" title="Direct link to Why Start With Admin Work?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Before we consider feature bounties or bug bounties, we need to acknowledge the day-to-day labor that enables these contributions to be merged and released. Paying for features while leaving critical administrative work unpaid would be unsustainable — and unfair.</p>
<p>This trial serves as the foundation for broader funding efforts in the future. However, it begins with respecting the work that is already being done.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_SAay" id="what-we-need-from-you">What We Need From You<a href="https://actualbudget.org/blog/spending-community-funds#what-we-need-from-you" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What We Need From You" title="Direct link to What We Need From You" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>We believe this is the right direction — but we won't go ahead without the community's support.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">If you're for it, against it, or have suggestions — let us know.</li>
<li class="">If there's strong opposition, we won't implement it.</li>
<li class="">If the community supports it, we'll begin the trial in July.</li>
</ul>
<p>Join the conversation on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/937901803608096828/940290142579605514/1381286169601511515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Discord</a> or leave anonymous feedback in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGRK__pOmMja3y_GMmF7RbMjtnmebWrbXvY0JXstoiJLb7Uw/viewform?usp=dialog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">this form</a>.
We're listening — and we'll publish a summary of the feedback before moving forward.</p>

<ul>
<li class="">We'll collect community feedback until late June.</li>
<li class="">If there's consensus, the 3-month trial begins July 1st.</li>
<li class="">After the trial, we'll evaluate how it went and where to go next.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you again for being part of this journey. This community runs on trust, time, and care. With your feedback, we can keep building something that works — for all of us.</p>]]></content:encoded>
